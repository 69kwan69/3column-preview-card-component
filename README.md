## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I thought grid should be used in this project so I learned it. Alas, only 2 lines of code were grid-related. At least this time I try to take the Mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

Mobile-first approach seems new and weird to me, but I'll stick with it next few projects.
